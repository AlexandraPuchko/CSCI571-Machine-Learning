# CSCI571-Machine-Learning


# Program 1

Program that trains and evaluates linear regression models. The source code is written in Java.
Program supports three use modes: training, prediction and evaluation. Training is the mode in which you estimate your
parameters from your training set; you can then use prediction mode to make predictions on new data points, or evaluation mode to make predictions on new data points and evaluate their performance against the correct outputs.


# Program 2

Program represetns a deep neural networkm written using Google TensorFlow Python library, which supports the following modes:
1. A standard single hidden layer neural network
2. An arbitrarily deep neural network
3. Both classifcation and regression modes
4. "Minibatch" training
