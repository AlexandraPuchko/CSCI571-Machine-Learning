1.  We are to implement a tool for creating neural networks of arbitrary size
  using tensorflow computational graphs, which will support two modes.
  Additionally, we are to do data preprocessing for minibatching.
2. We believe that learning  tensorflow and working with python will be the most
  challenging aspects of the assignment, since both of us are new to that.
3. We are planning to complete all the parts.
4. MT form 4pm-whenever
5. Documentation, videos, office hours.
